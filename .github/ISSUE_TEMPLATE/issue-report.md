**BEOFRE YOU SUBMIT AN ISSUE:** Please search the current set of issues for keywords related to the issue you're experiencing. It's entirely possible another ticket has already been made, and it helps to keep the same problem isolated to a single issue tracker, especially when it's producing numerous different effects. If you don't find an extent issue that fits precisely, but suspect your problem might be related to something you found, note those issue numbers and mention them in your ticket--it often helps us triage the problem to know there are similar, related issues, and if we do discover it's a duplicate that makes it quick and easy for us to collapse everything into one issue for tracking.
