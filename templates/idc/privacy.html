                <p>
                    Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Our website links to other National Institutes of
                    Health (NIH) sites, federal agency sites, and private organizations. Once you leave the primary IDC
                    site, you are subject to the privacy policy for the site(s) you are visiting. We collect some data
                    about your visit to our website to help us better understand how the public uses the site and how to
                    make it more helpful. We collect information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download
                    information from our website. We never collect information for commercial marketing or any purpose
                    unrelated to the IDC mission and goals.
                </p>

                <h2>Types of Information Collected</h2>
                <p>
                    When you browse through our website, certain information about your visit can be collected. We
                    automatically collect and store the following types of information about your visit:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Domain from which you access the Internet</li>
                    <li>IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when surfing the Web)</li>
                    <li>Operating system and information about the browser used when visiting the site</li>
                    <li>Date and time of your visit</li>
                    <li>Pages you visited</li>
                    <li>Address of the website that connected you to the IDC site (such as google.com or bing.com)</li>
                    <li>Information about which datasets are visited, linked to the IP address used to visit it
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and its various sections and
                    datasets to help make our site more useful to visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you download IDC-maintained data, you are interacting with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and/or
                    Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage buckets. While sign-in is not required to download data from
                    those public buckets, data may be collected if you are signed in. On AWS, your email ID may be
                    logged when downloading. On GCP, if you use the optional “requester pays”, your billing project ID
                    will be logged when downloading.
                </p>

                <h2>How IDC Collects Information</h2>
                <p>
                    IDC uses Google Analytics and Google Cloud Platform StackDriver Logging to collect the information
                    in the Types of Information Collected section above. Google Analytics and StackDriver gather
                    information automatically and continuously. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is
                    collected by these two systems. IDC staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data, and
                    those reports are only available to the NCI and NIH.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IDC retains the data from Google Analytics and StackDriver as long as needed to support the mission
                    of the IDC website and the NCI.
                </p>

                <h2>How IDC Uses Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    The Office of Management and Budget Memo
                    <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2010/m10-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies</a> (link is external) allows
                    Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on
                    your computer. The cookie allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit
                    while you are connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages. Cookies from IDC pages
                    only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect personal
                    information about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of cookies: single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Session
                    cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie
                    disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.
                </p>

                <h3>Session Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    IDC uses session cookies for technical purposes, such as to enable better navigation through our
                    site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo
                    10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1 — Single Session.” The policy
                    says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization
                    technologies."
                </p>

                <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    IDC uses persistent cookies to enable Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning
                    IDC visitors. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to IDC until they expire.
                    The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2 — Multi-session
                    without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use
                    of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."
                </p>

                <h2>Data Safeguarding and Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    IDC uses web measurement and customization technologies to help our websites function better for
                    visitors and to better understand how the public uses the online resources we provide. All uses of
                    web-based technologies comply with existing policies with respect to privacy and data safeguarding
                    standards.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Retention and Access Limits</h2>
                <p>
                    IDC will retain data collected long enough to achieve the specified
                    objective for which they were collected. The data generated from these activities falls under the
                    National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedule (GRS) 20-item IC
                    'Electronic Records,' and will be handled per the
                    <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs20.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    requirements of that schedule</a> (link is external).
